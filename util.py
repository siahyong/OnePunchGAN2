# Function to return the generator loss

    '''
    Return the loss of the generator given inputs.
    Parameters:
        gen: the generator; takes the condition and returns potential images
        disc: the discriminator; takes images and the condition and
          returns real/fake prediction matrices
        real: the real images (e.g. maps) to be used to evaluate the reconstruction
        condition: the source images (e.g. satellite imagery) which are used to produce the real images
        adv_criterion: the adversarial loss function; takes the discriminator 
                  predictions and the true labels and returns a adversarial 
                  loss (which you aim to minimize)
        recon_criterion: the reconstruction loss function; takes the generator 
                    outputs and the real images and returns a reconstructuion 
                    loss (which you aim to minimize)
        lambda_recon: the degree to which the reconstruction loss should be weighted in the sum
    '''
    # Steps: 1) Generate the fake images, based on the conditions.
    #        2) Evaluate the fake images and the condition with the discriminator.
    #        3) Calculate the adversarial and reconstruction losses.
    #        4) Add the two losses, weighting the reconstruction loss appropriately.
